title: Execution
---

import { CardGrid, Card, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

There are four varieties of Actions:

- if type is `file` and 'deploy first' is enabled, deploy the workspace, then:
- execute immediately,
- or they can be displayed for modification,
- or they can be prompted through the user interface.

## Execute Immediately

If we have a "**Call program**" command with a "Command to run" string like this:

```CL
CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME
```  

It will execute immediatly it is selected.

## Display for modification

<CardGrid>

<Card>


If the "Command to run" string has a leading `?` like `?CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME`, then the command is displayed and editable before command is executed.

<Card>

For example, you might want to add `PARM('Douglas' 'Adams')` to the end.

## Prompted

Rather than using the "?", you can have the Action prompt for values.
The "Command to run" string can have embedded prompt string(s) to invoke prompting.

A "prompt string" has the format ``${NAME|LABEL|[DEFAULTVALUE]}`` where:

- NAME is an arbitrary name for the prompt field, but must be unique for this action.
- LABEL is the text to describe the prompt field.
- [DEFAULTVALUE] is an **optional** value to pre-populate the prompt field.

### Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Example 1">
Suppose we have a "**Call program, prompt for parms**" action with the "Command to run" defined like this:

```CL
CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME PARM('${AAA|First name|Your name}' '${xyz|Last Name}')
```

If we run the action it prompts like this:

![Prompting Action Example 1](../../../../assets/actions_exec_03.png)

If we complete the screen like this:

and click **Execute** a command like this is executed;

```CL
CALL LENNONS1/ATEST PARM('Douglas' 'Adams')
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Example 2">
You can also use variables in the prompt string. If an action is defined like this:

```CL
CALL &LIBRARY/&NAME PARM('${AAA|Library|&CURLIB}' '${xyz|Report Name}')
```

&CURLIB will be substituted and the prompt will look like this when executed:

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Example 3">
Here's a more complex example of a "**Run CRTBNDRPG (inputs)**" action.
The 'Command to run" string is defined like this:

```CL
CRTBNDRPG PGM(${buildlib|Build library|&BUILDLIB}/${objectname|Object Name|&NAME}) SRCSTMF('${sourcePath|Source path|&FULLPATH}') OPTION(*EVENTF) DBGVIEW(*SOURCE) TGTRLS(*CURRENT)
```

When executed, it prompts like this:
