Source dates are supported in Code for IBM i, but not by default.

## Prerequisites to using source dates
For source dates to be enabled, the QCCSID system value must not be 65535. See [our documentation about encoding](../../tips/ccsid/) and [IBM's documentation about the QCCSID system value](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=faqs-i-system-value-qccsid)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" />.

## Source date settings

Source dates can be enabled in the connection settings.

There are three options pertaining to source dates:

* *Enable Source Dates*: If source date support is enabled for source members
* *Source date tracking mode*: What type of mode should be used to track changes. More below.
* *Source Dates in Gutter*: Whether the source dates should appear in the gutter of the editor when enabled

## Tracking modes

There are two types of editing modes for source dates

* *Edit mode* which is the traditional style for editing. When a line changes, the source date of that line will be updated. It does not understand undo/redo. It is considered the 'dumb' mode.
* *Diff mode* is the modern approach to source date tracking. Instead of tracking edits line by line, it is doing [a diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" /> to understand what has changed in the document. It diffs the base document (from last open or last save) against the latest dirty version of the document. This is a Test enhancement. It does understand undo/redo. It is considered the 'smarter' mode of the two modes.

## Source date filtering

<CardGrid>

<Card>

This feature is only enabled when using 'Diff mode' tracking, as well as having the source dates gutter enabled.

Hovering over the gutter will show two buttons to:

* show changes since last save, which opens a new diff view with the changes
* start a new search based on the source date

<CardGrid>

<Card>

Starting a search based on date will allow the user to enter a new date filter in `YYMMDD` format. The gutter will highlight any dates on or after the date the user entered.

Hovering over the gutter again will show another button to clear the filter.

There is also a button on the status bar the user can use to start a new date filter.
