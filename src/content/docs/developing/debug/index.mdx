# ILE Debugging

Debugging ILE programs is now available inside of Visual Studio Code. We've added UI to make sure setting up the Debug Service to be a swift process.

<Aside type="note">You must have `bash` set as your default shell. [See Bash Shell Required](/docs/tips/bash/) for more info. </Aside>

# Starting to debug

<CardGrid>

<Card>

After configuring the Debug Service, launching a debug session is a click of a button away. When you have active source open, a new Debug button will appear in the navigation bar. Breakpoints can be set prior to debugging, or during the debugging session.

Clicking the Debug button will display an input box which will allow the user to customise the command which starts the debug job. This allows the developer to pass in parameters, or call another program to launch the debug session.

After the debug session has started, every session will break on entry. You can read more about the debugging UI on the [Debug actions section on the Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_debug-actions)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" />.

To debug a program from the Object Browser, right-click on the program object and select the **Debug Program** option. Like before this will also display an input box to modify the command which starts the debug job.

  * installed into Visual Studio Code
* Debug Service Certificates setup
  * As of Code for IBM i 2.16.0, the Debug Service is configured inside of Navigator for IBM i. **If you're using Code for IBM i 2.16.0**, then you are required to use this method to configure and start the Debug Service. Code for IBM i 2.16.0+ supports only Debug Service 3+.

<Aside type="note">
   IBM i 7.5 Java PTF Group SF99955 level 15 and IBM i 7.4 Java PTF Group SF99665 level 28 contained two defective PTF's for Java 11. These PTF's has now been superceded by newer PTF's included in PTF Group SF99955 level 16 for 7.5 and PTF Group SF99665 level 29 for 7.4.

</Tabs>

After you have installed the PTFs, the connection inside of Visual Studio Code will need to be restarted.

## Configuring & starting the service

This must be done with user that has *ALLOBJ and *SYSADM privlages.
Below are the base requirements to configure the certificate:
- Master key 1 is set (this can be done in Navigator for IBM i under Security > Cryptographic Services Key Management > Manage Master Keys)
- *SYSTEM store is populated with a valid certificate (this can be done in Digital Certificate Manager)

1. On Navigator for IBM i, go to Network > Servers > TCP/IP Servers
2. Scroll down to System Debugger and right click
3. Hover over Stop Instance, select Debug Service
![](image-4.png)
4. Right click System Debugger again, select Regenerate Debug Service Trust Store
![](image-3.png)
5. Enter in the password for the *SYSTEM store, click OK
![](image-1.png)
6. Select the certificate you want to use, click OK
![](image-2.png)
7. Right click System Debugger again, hover over Start Instance, select Debug Service
![](image-5.png)

**NOTE:** This needs to be done each time you renew or replace that certificate, it does not automatically update when you update the *SYSTEM store

## Updating the service

When there are newer Debug service or Navigator/HTTP Group PTFs, the following steps might be required:
1. Restart ADMIN1 server
   - If HTTP Group PTF does not show as applied, IPL might be required.
2. Regenerate debug service trust store (as described above)

# Common issues

## Debug hangs

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/codefori/vscode-ibmi/issues/1059)<Icon name="github" class="icon-inline" /> that when you start debugging from VS Code, the debugger hangs and doesn't launch.

The fix is to check if you've got a prior debug job stuck in `MSGW`. You can do this with `WRKACTJOB`, or a similar command like `WRKSBSJOB QBATCH`.

**Users should no longer face this issue** as we now submit debug jobs to `QSYSWRK` with `QSYSNOMAX`.

## `STRDBGSVR` requirement

The Debug Service that is started depends on the traditional Debug Server.

![](./error_2.png)

If you receive this message, do as it says. Simply start the Debug Server with `STRDBGSVR` from a greenscreen.

## IP not in cert list

**It is always recommended you use a hostname in the connection settings to make use of the debugger**.

![](./error_1.png)

*Error that is shown when connecting to the debugger if connecting using an IP address.*

This error occurs when the hostname used to connect to the debugger (which might be the IP address that was configured in the connection settings) is not the same as the host name created as part of the certificate.

If you are using a system that doesn't have a host name (for example `YOURSYSTEM`, or `pub400.com`), then an entry should be added to your device's 'hosts' file. This entry should be the same on all devices in your network to ensure that everyone is using the same hostname.

* Windows: `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
* Mac: `/etc/hosts`

Your entry might look like this:

```txt title="hosts" {2}
# IP HOSTNAME
192.168.0.20 MYIBMI
```

If you find that you've added your local hostname entry and the error is still occurring, then you may need to delete the existing certificates from `/QIBM/ProdData/IBMiDebugService/bin/certs` on the IFS and generate them again in the Walkthrough.
