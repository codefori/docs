The Db2 for i extension allows users to browse database schemas, execute SQL statements, and more, on an IBM i.

![](./images/main.png)

## Install

The extension can be [installed from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.vscode-db2i)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" /> and is also part of the [IBM i Development Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack)<Icon name="external" color="cyan" class="icon-inline" />.

### Server Component

As of 0.3.0, the Db2 for i extension requires a server component. The component provides improved performance and makes it easy for us to add advanced features. The Db2 for i extension manages the server component installation when you connect to an IBM i with Code for IBM i and will ask the user to confirm any installation or update. The server component is installed into `$HOME/.vscode`, which means a per-user installation. [The server component is also open-source](https://github.com/ThePrez/CodeForIBMiServer)<Icon name="github" class="icon-inline" />.

## Executing statements

Either:

* open an existing `.sql` file (source member, streamfile or local file)
* create a new file
    1. create a file (control / command + N)
    2. change the language ID to `sql`

After you have an SQL file open, you can either:

* Move your cursor onto the statement you want to execute and:
    * use the play button in the top right to execute
    * use the shortcut (control / command + R) to execute the statement

The result set will appear below the statement. As your scroll through the result set, more data will load. When you execute an SQL statement, it will be prepended to your Query History view, where it remains readily accessible.

SQL statements are executed using the active job selected in the SQL Job Manager view.

### SQL prefixes

SQL provided by Db2 for i allows you to run CL commands in a script. Additionally there are `json`, `csv`, `sql` and `rpg` prefixes, which will open the result set in the chosen format.

```sql
-- result set as normal table
select * from sample.employee;

-- result set as JSON, will open in a new file
json: select * from sample.employee;

-- result set as CSV, will open in a new file
csv: select * from sample.employee;

-- result set as SQL insert statement
sql: select * from sample.employee;

-- RPG data structure based on result set columns
rpg: select * from sample.employee;

-- run CL commands. output is directed to IBM i output channel
cl: dspffd sample/employee
```

### Updatable cells

It's possible to update directly from running a SQL statement. You can use the `update:` prefix with a select statement to make the result set updatable. This will allow you to edit the data in the result set and then save the changes back to the database.

A fully qualified table name is required for the fields to be editable.

```sql
update: select * from sample.employee;
```

#### Using nulls

Enter the value `null` to set a column to *null*. If the column cannot accept at least 4 characters, then `-` (a dash) may be used.

### Binding parameters

It is possible to bind to SQL parameters inside of SQL statements - both `?` markers and named parameters (e.g. `:param1`) are supported - by using the `bind:` prefix. `bind:` is followed by a list of strings or numbers, either space or comma separated. When executing the prefix, it will find the most previous statement in the document to bind to.

```sql
select * from employee where empno = ?;

bind: '000010';
bind: '000020';

select * from employee where empno = ? and workdept = ?;

bind: '000010', 'A00';
bind: '000020', 'A00';
```

## Syntax checking

When connected to an IBM i, the syntax checker has the following options:

* as you edit an SQL file, the statement being edited will be syntax checked after a short period of time (enabled by default)
* when you open an SQL file, the entire document will be checked (disabled by default and has a limit of 200 statements in the document)
* when the 'check syntax' button is pressed, which is shown when an SQL document is open and are connected to a system (has the same statement limit)

The syntax checker configuration is available through the VS Code settings (and not the Connection Settings).

<Aside type="tip">
  Use the `{}` (brackets icon) near the language ID in the status bar to see if the syntax checker is enabled or not. This is shown in the screenshot above.
</Aside>

## SQL Job Manager

This view allows users to manage different SQL jobs, each with their own unique JDBC configuration. A new job can be created by clicking the database icon in the SQL Job Manage title bar. Or, if you have not created a new job before, there is a big button to do the same action.

![](./images/sqlJobManager-newJob.png)

Your active job will be marked with a highlighted icon. **The active job is used for all SQL statement execution**, including SQL that powers the Schema Browser, user-executed SQL statements, etc. You can change the active job by simply clicking the job you choose to use. You will see the highlighted icon change to indicate the active job.

### Editing job configuration

You can use the pencil icon on any job to edit the JDBC properties. When the Apply Changes button is pressed, any changes are saved and the job is restarted, to fully apply the changes.

You are able to right-click on any job to save those job settings, allowing it to be easily reused. Using the 'Save settings to config' right-click action will prompt you to enter a name for the configuration. Once saved, you will see a 'Saved Configuration' folder appear, with all your saved configs. Clicking on a saved config will launch a new job with those pre-defined settings. You can use the pencil icon on any saved configuration to edit it.

## Using the Schema Browser

The Db2 for i extension adds a view called Schema Browser which allows the user to add existing schemas to the list and will allow them to browse existing database objects. You can right-click on SQL objects to show more actions. Each SQL object type may have unique actions. 

<Aside type="note">
   The Schema Browser requires an active SQL Job to function.
</Aside>

### Viewing table contents

If you are using the Schema Browser to browse objects, you are able to use the 'View contents' icon when hovering over a table, view, or alias to cause a basic SQL select statement to be generated and executed.


## Using Examples

The Examples view provides users with a set of SQL example scripts that can be used as a learning tool or as a starting point for their own SQL scripts. These examples are grouped into categories to make it easy to find what you are looking for. You can hover over any example to get a preview of the SQL script or click on it to open a copy which you can freely edit.

![](./images/examplesPreview.png)

On top of the built-in examples, users can also add specific directories containing their own SQL examples using the `Add...` button under the `Custom Examples Directories` submenu on the Examples view. All SQL files in the specified directories and at most one subdirectory level deeper will be picked up. By default, the folder name will be the category and the file name will be the name of the example. This can be customized by optionally including a comment in the file with the tags `category` and `description`.

![](./images/examplesAdd.png)

Once you have added a custom examples directory, you can quickly save new examples to that directory using the `Save As New Example` button in the Examples view.

![](./images/examplesSave.png)

## SQL Error Logging Facility (SELF)

SQL Error Logging Facility (SELF) offers a comprehensive view that can help users understand specific SQL errors or warnings. The SELF view can be accessed through the IBM i panel next to the Results View. 

Additional documentation of SELF can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=tools-sql-error-logging-facility-self)

![](./images/selfcodes.png)

Each item in the SELF view is for a specific `SQLCODE` which is displayed in parenthesis. The `SQLCODE` tracks the actual error or warning triggered by a given SQL statement. 

- An error SQLCODE must be preceded by a single minus sign ('-').
- A warning SQLCODE can be preceded by an optional plus sign ('+').

When an item is expanded or hovered over, information about the `SQLCODE` is displayed such as the Job Name, Call Stack, Additional Details, and the SQL statement. The counter on the right of each item denotes the number of occurrences(🔥) of the specific `SQLCODE` . Once the number of occurrences for a given code is greater than 100, we display 💯.

### Enabling SELF in VSCode

To capture SQL errors or warnings, enable the SELF Default in your VSCode settings. This will be the Default `SYSIBMADM.SELFCODES` global variable for all jobs. By default, the `SELFCODES` level is set to *NONE.

- *ERROR specifies all SQLCODEs that are error conditions (negative values).
- *WARN specifies all SQLCODEs that are warning conditions (positive
values).
- *ALL specifies all SQLCODEs that are error or warning conditions.
- *NONE turns off SELF processing.

![](./images/selfdefault.png)

The SELF Level can also be set on a per job basis by right clicking on the active job in the [SQL Job Manager](#sql-job-manager)

### Auto Refresh

![](./images/selfauto.png)

We added the option for users to configure `Auto Refresh` on the SELF view. When enabled, the SELF view will update on a constant interval (every 30 seconds). The SELF view can be cleared by clicking the trash icon. 

## Visual Explain

We have added Visual Explain into the database extension with a more lightweight approach of explain data. The typical run button on the document now has options to either run, run and explain or explain without running, which will show the explain nodes and node details in the same result set view.

The Visual Explain view has a button on the header to control which nodes should be highlights, as well as the ability to export the data as JSON, and more.

## Notebooks

Notebooks now supports Db2 for IBM i when using the database extension. If you have not heard of Notebooks before, [check out this blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/11/08/custom-notebooks) on the Visual Studio Blog. IBM i Notebooks allow users to build documents of markdown, SQL statements and CL commands all in one view, that can be saved, re-used, re-run and shared to other people. This allows you to create documentation, a step-by-step guide, and many other things, specifically for IBM i.

<Aside type="tip">
We are expecting a full release of Notebooks in vscode-db2i 1.0.0.
</Aside>

### How to create a Notebook

There are a few ways to create an IBM i Notebook:

1. You can use the 'New Notebook' button on the SQL Job Manager
2. You can find 'IBMi i: New Notebook' in the command palette.
3. Open a `.inb` file (which stands for 'i Notebook')

**You can also find Notebook samples from the Examples view, under Notebooks.**

### The life of a Notebook

A notebook is made up of cells. A cell is associated with a language (for example, `sql`, `cl`, or `markdown`). Cells (other than `markdown`) can be executed. Each cell has a result and typically gets rendered below the cell input after execution. 

Execution is different for each language type:

* If it is `sql`, then a table will be returned of the result set. Notebooks do not support paging - it will return all rows. The SQL statements will be executed through the selected job in the SQL Job Manager.
* If the language is `cl`, then when it is executed it will run a CL command and return the resulting output.

You are able to use the stop and play buttons on the cells to request a cancellation of the execution. There is also a 'Run All' button, which will execute all cells.

### Charting with SQL

Notebooks have the power to chart data that is returned from the database. It is most useful for rendering numerical data (on the Y axis) by another value (on the X axix). Here are the supported chart types, which are used for specifying the chart type:

* bar
* line
* doughnut
* pie
* polar area (`polarArea`)
* radar

To render a chart using SQL in a Notebook, two rules must be met:

1. You must provide the chart type (via comment tag or statement prefix)
2. There must be a `LABEL` column for the X axis.
3. One or more numeric columns for the plotted data
   * You can also provide a `_desc` string column for each numeric column to provide additional information in the tooltip
   * For numeric columns to use formatted names, provide a fixed column name: `salary as "Salary"`

Optional tags as comments can also be provided. Optional tags are formatted as so:

* `chart` - which can be used instead of the chart prefix
* `title` - appears above the chart for a title
* `y` - for a title to appear on the Y axis
* `hideStatement` - only accepts `true`, and when provided will hide the SQL statement from the exported Notebook
